Here is an old style 
[article](https://community.hortonworks.com/articles/80412/working-with-airbnbs-superset.html) 
on superset with installation steps. Even this impressive 
[article](https://shuaiw.github.io/2017/08/26/building-beautiful-dashboards-with-superset.html) 
references installation steps.

This superset dockerhub [page](https://hub.docker.com/r/tylerfowler/superset) outlines 
a simple way to bring superset up with docker. In addition, the original authors of the articles
could include Dockerfiles or docker-compose files that include their additional content like 
databases with content. This simplifies the usage and focuses the reader on the technology itself 
and not its installation process. I have written a [tutorial](tutorial.md) to bring the old and new together.

Docker/kubernetes can be used as a communication mechanism for sharing of new technologies 
and ideas.
